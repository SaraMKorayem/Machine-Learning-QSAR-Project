QSAR Modeling of PPARγ Biological Data: Random Forest Model Deployment and pIC50 Prediction Using ChEMBL IDs and SMILES
Abstract
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling has been pivotal in computer-aided drug design for decades. Leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, we targeted Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ), a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism linked to various metabolic disorders. Our QSAR machine learning model predicted bioactivity and calculated pIC50 values to identify potential PPARγ inhibitors. Data from the ChEMBL database underwent preprocessing and feature engineering, including Lipinski descriptors and IC50 to pIC50 conversion. Using a Random Forest regression model, we evaluated performance via R-squared and RMSE metrics. Results indicated significant molecular traits influencing PPARγ activation, with lower molecular weight and higher hydrophilicity correlating with greater bioactivity. Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) showed significant differences between active and inactive compounds across various descriptors. These insights into PPARγ inhibitors' structure-activity relationships facilitate the rational design of new therapeutic agents, highlighting AI-driven QSAR modeling's potential in accelerating drug discovery for metabolic disorders. The developed model has been deployed for further drug discovery applications.

Introduction
In computer-aided drug design, quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modelling is a commonly utilised methodology that was first presented sixty years ago. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence methods, such deep learning, the quick expansion of chemical databases for virtual screening, and significant increases in processing power have all contributed to the birth of a new category of QSAR applications that we refer to as "deep QSAR." (Tropsha et al., 2023).
Of all the nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, or PPARs, have shown promise as therapeutic targets for the development of new pharmacotherapeutic candidates against malignancies, insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular illnesses. PPARγ antagonists have a broader range of applications in medicine than diabetes therapy since they stimulate osteoblast development and inhibit adipose tissue differentiation. Therefore, it seems sense to consider PPARγ inhibitors as possible candidates for osteoporosis and obesity treatment. Furthermore, PPARγ inhibitors exhibit extensive antitumor efficacy. Consequently, investigating PPARγ inhibitors is crucial for the search for new therapeutic candidates to treat PPARγ-related metabolic diseases (Ipsa Padhy et al., 2024).
   
In both human and animal models of diabetes mellitus (DM), myocardial fibrosis is a key factor in the development of diabetic heart failure. Myofibroblasts, which are absent from healthy hearts, are generated when cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are activated in response to injury or stimulation. It has been demonstrated that inhibiting Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) enhances myocardial fibroblast activation and differentiation (Li et al., 2024). Insulin-sensitizing drugs called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists are used to treat hyperglycemia with insulin resistance. PPARγ agonists, including pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, have been widely advised for the treatment of type 2 diabetes thus far. PPAR-agonists may be used in conjunction with insulin or other hypoglycemic medications in specific circumstances. Because they lower blood sugar, PPAR-agonists are thought to be helpful in preventing strokes (Janani & Ranjitha Kumari, 2015).
This project focused on PPARγ as a target inhibitor for diabetic drug development. Since PPARγ is associated with metabolic disorders and a member of the nuclear receptor family, is a critical regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, making it a promising target for treating a variety of metabolic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. A QSAR machine learning model was developed to predict the bioactivity of molecular descriptors and calculate pIC50 values, aiming to discover potential drug candidates. This approach leverages the advancements in AI and deep learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying novel PPARγ inhibitors.

Methodology
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is outlined. Initially, data collection and preprocessing are performed by selecting the target protein Peroxisome proliferated activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) associated with diabetes from the ChEMBL database and retrieving bioactivity data reported as IC50 values in nM units. Missing data is handled by removing compounds with incomplete information.

Following data exploration, feature engineering involves calculating molecular descriptors and selecting relevant features for model development. Bioactivity data was classified into "active," "inactive," or "intermediate" categories based on IC50 values, facilitating subsequent analysis. Relevant features, including molecule identifiers, canonical SMILES representing chemical structures, and bioactivity values, are selected and combined with corresponding bioactivity classes. Lipinski descriptors, pivotal for evaluating drug-likeness according to Lipinski's Rule of Five, are then computed from canonical SMILES. These descriptors encompass molecular weight, LogP, and counts of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Finally, the calculated descriptors are merged with the original dataset, forming a comprehensive DataFrame for further exploration and QSAR modeling.

IC50 values are converted to a negative logarithmic scale, termed as pIC50, ensuring uniformity in bioactivity data across different scales. This is achieved through a custom function, pIC50(), which transforms IC50 values from nanomolar to molar units, applies the negative logarithmic transformation, and integrates the results into a new DataFrame column while removing the original standard_value_norm column. Subsequently, the normalization of standard values is carried out to cap values exceeding 100,000,000 nM and prevent negative logarithmic values. Relevant columns are retained for further analysis, and compounds labeled as 'intermediate' in the bioactivity class are excluded.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) follows, employing Lipinski descriptors to explore the chemical space occupied by 'active' and 'inactive' compounds. Visualizations such as scatter plots and box plots are generated to visualize the distribution of bioactivity classes and assess the significance of differences in molecular descriptors between classes. Statistical tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test, are conducted to evaluate these differences. Results are interpreted to discern meaningful relationships and identify descriptors crucial for distinguishing between bioactivity classes. Finally, processed data and visualizations are exported for further analysis and documentation.

Dataset was prepared for building a regression model of inhibitors using the random forest algorithm. Initially, molecular descriptors are calculated using the PaDEL-Descriptor tool, enabling the quantitative description of compounds in the dataset. The bioactivity data, containing pIC50 values, is loaded from a previously pre-processed ChEMBL dataset. The dataset is then divided into input features (X) and the target variable (Y), followed by the removal of low variance features. Subsequently, the data is split into training and testing sets in an 80/20 ratio. A regression model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, with 100 estimators. Model performance is evaluated using R-squared values and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and a scatter plot of experimental versus predicted pIC50 values is generated. Additionally, the code showcases the use of the LazyPredict library to compare multiple machine learning algorithms for regression modeling. The top-performing model, which was Random Forest is selected based on adjusted R-squared, R-squared, RMSE, and computation time metrics. Finally, the selected model is trained and saved for deployment, with label encoding applied to resolve potential issues with the 'molecule_chembl_id', ‘canonical_smiles’ and ‘bioactivity_class’ columns. The process concludes with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and saving the trained model using both joblib and pickle libraries. The saved model was used for deployment using streamlit.

Results 
 
The bar chart illustrates the distribution of compounds across different bioactivity classes. The x-axis of the chart represents the bioactivity class, with two categories: "active" and "inactive." Meanwhile, the y-axis denotes the frequency, ranging from 0 to 1200, indicating the number of compounds classified into each category. This observation underscores a notable prevalence of compounds classified as "active" within the dataset, suggesting a higher frequency of bioactive compounds compared to inactive ones.

 
The analysis of molecular weight (MW) and LogP (the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient) reveals valuable insights into the molecular characteristics influencing the activation of PPAR gamma. A lower molecular weight suggests a smaller molecule size, and the observed trend implies that smaller molecules might exhibit greater effectiveness in activating PPAR gamma. Conversely, LogP indicates the hydrophobicity of a molecule, with lower LogP values indicating higher hydrophilicity. The analysis suggests a trend where more hydrophilic molecules, characterized by lower LogP values, may possess greater potential for activating PPAR gamma. These findings provide valuable guidance for further exploration of structure-activity relationships and the rational design of compounds with enhanced PPAR gamma activation properties.
